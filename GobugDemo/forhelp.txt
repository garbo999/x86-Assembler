To read the combined help file "GoBug.chm" you need the latest
version of help.  You can get this by running the Microsoft 
self-executing file Hhupd.exe.  This is available from www.microsoft.com.
In that site just enter Hhupd.exe as a search line.
If you still have trouble e-mail me on jg@jgnet.co.uk.
